## AI-powered webpage Scraper/Parser

We use Playwright to scrape text from and take screenshots of webpages.

Then local LLMs (running with Ollama) are used to parse the scraped text and screenshots to extract relevant information.

As an example use-case, we attempt to use our technique to extract business directory listings from scraped webpages (obtained from a google search).
